# Module 2 Assessment Exercise

The assessment you are about to complete will aid you in validating your understanding of the module 1objectives:

- SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN statements
- ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses
- INSERT and UPDATE statements
- DAO methods
- Creating domain objects from SQL data

It will also give you practice with coding assessments you may encounter during the job interview process.

## Overview

This is a time-boxed, individual coding assessment. You will have one hour to complete as much of your assigned problem as you can. You are not expected to complete all features of problem in the time given. Complete as much as you can.

You may use any resource available in the classroom except another Human Being. This is an individual effort.

Whatever you complete should not have compile or run-time errors. Any features you are able to complete should run successfully.

Any unit tests should also be error free and run successfully.

If you are nearing the end of the time-box and you have compile/run-time errors or tests that have compile errors, consider commenting out or removing the code causing the errors before you push your final effort.

At the end of the time-box you should have your final effort pushed to your class repository.

You are expected to remain in the classroom until you have completed the coding assessment.

If you get done before the end of the time-box, please be respectful of those still working. Please leave the classroom if you would like to talk with others that have completed the coding assessment.

## Instructions

1. Pull from your class repository like you do for code every day. The assessment will be in the module-1 folder of your class repo folder.
2. Open the project in the Module_1_Coding_Assessment folder.
3. You should see two folders, a `part-1` and a `part-2`.
4. Begin with `part-1`. Enter that folder in your command line and run `sh import-databases.sh`.
5. Fill out the `solution.sql` file with the correct SQL statements to satisfy the requirements.
6. `part-2` represents a DAO project that you will finish. Complete the `DAO` class and use the unit tests to check the correctness of the methods.
7. Be sure to push your final effort when you are done or at the end of the time-box.
8. Your instructor will let you know when to begin and give you a "10-minute warning" before the end of the time-box.
